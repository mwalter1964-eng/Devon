  Devon Browser Extension - Privacy Policy

  Last updated: December 2024

  Overview

  Devon is a browser extension that enhances Azure DevOps with dual-pane navigation, work item previews, and an improved rich text editor. This policy describes how the extension handles user data.

  Data Collection

  Devon collects and stores the following data locally in your browser:

  - Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT): Used to authenticate API calls to read and update work items. Stored in Chrome sync storage.
  - User preferences: Settings such as dual-pane mode state and editor configuration.

  Data Usage

  All collected data is used solely to provide the extension's functionality:
  - Your PAT is sent only to Azure DevOps APIs (dev.azure.com, visualstudio.com) to authenticate requests.
  - Preferences are stored locally to maintain your settings across sessions.

  Data Sharing

  Devon does not:
  - Sell or transfer any user data to third parties
  - Collect analytics or telemetry
  - Track browsing history or user activity
  - Send data to any servers other than Azure DevOps

  Data Storage

  All data remains in your browser's local storage and Chrome sync storage. No data is transmitted to external servers controlled by the extension developer.
